# Hi!

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Josie, I work in IT and im glad to welcome you here to this blog. 

## Why I created this blog

I have been thinking about blogging since a few years, but I have never had to motivation to actually start one. But recently I have gotten another push. I watched a video by [Nathan Laundry](https://nathanlaundry.com/), which was about digital minimalism and the attention economy. About how everything nowadays is trying to capture your attention as much as possible, to monetize it. 
Of course I knew this in the back of my mind but I haven't actually given much thought to it so far. Since watching this video I have cut my phone time in more than half, completely quit some digital addictions and improved my life greatly. 
And then I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0osJhQ-JCQ), about how much of our internet use is distributed around just a few different websites, and how we should try to reclaim it. By making our own small sites, linking to each other, building the small web again. And that inspired me to actually start writing here. That and that having a blog can be a great creative and emotional outlet. 

## What you can expect from this Blog

What you can expect here are articles about Software, Homelabbing, Hosting and such things. In fact if you are reading this I will probably already have my second post up: A breakdown to how this site is written, built and deployed. With a full guide to how you can do this yourself! Until next time!

~ Josie
